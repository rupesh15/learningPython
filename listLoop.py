# Looping in the List

# nameList = ["my","name","is","rupesh"];
# for name in nameList:
#     print(name)

# List can also be itterated using Loop through index number
# Use the range() and len() function to create a suitable iterable.

# range -> range(start,stop, step)
# start: Optional: An interger number specifying at which position to start. Default value is 0
# stop: Required: An integer number specifying at which position to stop. (not included)
# step: Optional: An integer number specifying the incrementation. Default is 1;

# for value in range(1,100,5):
#     print(value)

# Using while loop

# data = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']
# i = 0
# while i < len(data):
#     print(data[i])
#     i = i + 1

# A short hand for loop that will print all value.
# [print(x) for x in data]
